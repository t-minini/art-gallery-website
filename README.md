### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=1269s) - This channel is amazing, and this helped me to solve the CSS Grid for this project.
- [useLocation hook from react-router](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl1Vtp--nhE&t=5s) - This video helped me to use the useLocation Hook to apply a different styling to the Footer component, depending on the location of the page.
